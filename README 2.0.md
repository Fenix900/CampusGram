# The project
## The main purpose of the project

This project will be a webpage that will let users upload images to a database. When the user wants to upload an image they will have to sign in or create a user with a password and name. When they've done it they will get the option to either upload an image or view the uploaded images. When the user uploads an image they will have to specify something about the image with either predefined words that are supposed to describe the image to categorize them, like "dog", "car", "sunset" or "document". These categorizations will be used to easier search in the data base. So the user will be able to search for a specific word that describes the image. When a user uploads an image, other users will be able to log in and choose between different users and see their uploaded images. Another way to see the photos was as said before by using the search bar, but this part is not prio one and will if so implemented later if time allows. 

## Users

There will be a sign in so that different users can upload to the database with different usernames and credentials. If a person doesn't have a account they can just create one. These users will be stored in the data based with their corresponding library. When other users want to see what this person has uploaded they will get the information from a user and what images exist on their data base. 

## Uploading and search function

The uploading part is what I will be going with but are a bit unsure about the nametag part where I can put text for each image. Maybe just having a predefined number of categories that the user can choose from is good in a drop down menu. Or that the user can write a free text about the image and that can be an description. So when the user wants to search in the data base they can just type in keywords and the algorithm will find the images with these words in the description and show them. Last idea is to maybe just let the user set a name for the image. The catogoriz might be a bit easier but more limited. Im still a bit unsure about this part and if I should have a search part, just a name might be enough to store them. 

I am also a bit unsure about what backend I shouold use since I haven't worked much with backend. I will be working with react, so whoever reads this might be able to give me some options of databases/backend I should use, anything that is the best? Maybe use Firebase?

## Viewing images

The images will be viewed in each persons profile, so the user gets to choose a user to see their gallery and images they have uploaded, the users will be choosen from a list or somehting like that. Then the webpage will make a request to the database to get all the images and then display them for example in uploaded time order. The user will not be able to do much more than just viewing the images, no interaction with the images will be available, maybe to download them but nothing I have planned to implement. 


# Improvments so I get enough to pass this course
I will be adding likes and comments to the images each user uploads, so now the other users will be able to like and comment on images. The user who uploads the image will also be able to add tags to their image, these tags will let other users easily search for tags, so either you could search by user or tags but also the description of what the owner of the image has wrote. These comments will happen in real time and people will be able to talk in the comments. 

The users will also be able to create albums/galleries to save images, not only their own but others too. So they can organize images with like albums with names. Then other people can come to that profile and see your albums and what u have saved. 

Each user will also be able to customize their profile with like a short text and an profile picture. But if time allows I will be adding the feature to save other users, like favourite, so you have easy access to their profile. 

This app will me very much like instagrams features
