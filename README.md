## The project
# The main purpose of the project

This project will be a webpage that will let users upload images to a database. When the user wants to upload an image they will have to sign in or create a user with a password and name. When they've done it they will get the option to either upload an image or view the uploaded images. There will be an admin that can see all the uploaded images on the data base. When the user uploads an image they will have to specify something about the image with either predefined words that are supposed to describe the image to categorize them, like "dog", "car", "sunset" or "document". These categorizations will be used to easier search in the data base. So the user will be able to search for a specific word that describes the image. 

# Users

There will be a sign in way so that different users can upload to the database with different usernames and credentials. This is most likely how it is going to be but I think that maybe that I want to create a passwords or some passwords that can be used by everyone and sign in and see all uploaded images. So like one password will let anyone see evey photo on the server. But to have several users might be a better idea. 

# Uploading

The uploading part is what I will be going with but are a bit unsure about the nametag part where I can put text for each image. Maybe just having a predefined number of categories, or that the user can write a free text about the image and that can be an description. So when the user wants to search in the data base they can just type in keywords and the algorithm will find the images with these words in the description and show them. The catogoriz might be a bit easier but more limited.
